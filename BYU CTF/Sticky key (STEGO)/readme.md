### Chal Desc: 

I just got this email from my friend. 
I think he was trying to tell me something important, but it just looks like random symbols.

```java
Subject: ˆ ˇ˙ˆ˜˚ Â¥ ´¥∫øå®∂ ˆß ∫®ø˚´˜
Contents: ˆ †˙ˆ˜˚ µ¥ ˚´¥∫øå®∂ ˆß ∫®ø˚´˜≥ ˆ ∑åß π¬å˜˜ˆ˜© †ø †´¬¬ ¥ø¨ †˙ˆß ∫¨† ˆæµ ˜ø† ß¨®´ ˙ø∑ ¥ø¨ ∑ˆ¬¬ ®´å∂ ˆ†≥ Óøπ´ƒ¨¬¬¥ ¥ø¨ çå˜ ƒˆ˜∂ å ∑å¥≥ ∫¥¨ç†ƒ”∂ø˜†—¬´å√´—ßø∂å—∫¥—¥ø¨®—˚´¥∫øå®∂’
```

Soln:

If we try to google the given set of symbols, the first link which comes up is [LINGOJAM](https://lingojam.com/SymbolLanguageTranslator) which says it is a *Symbol language*.

Decoding the given symbols we get,

```
Subject: i think my keyboard is broken
contents: i think my keyboard is broken. i was planning to tell you this but iæm not sure how you will read it.
hopefully you can find a way. byuctf”dont—leave—soda—by—your—keyboard’
```

If we change the hyphens with underscore, the flag is right infront.

Thank you
