### Vanishing of Dr. Kumar

---

This challenge was pretty straightforward. We are given a mp4 file, first thing which strikes is ffmpeg but before I just check for
spectrogram using sonic visualizer which gives the flag.

Open the mp4 file in sonic visualizer and click `add spectogram` and flag is displayed.
