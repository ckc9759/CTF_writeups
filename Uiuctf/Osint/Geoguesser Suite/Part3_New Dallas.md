The given image seems to be taken from a `dashcam` ( Dashboard camera ) and the number plates have been blurred ( geoguesser chall for a reason ).

The description mentions something about trains `Super wide roads with trains... Is this the new Dallas?` so our first thought was to research the train. We couldn't get much info by searching for the train (Got some results for `Shanghai Metro train line 16` but ignored ) as it was too small to identify any details.

Searching for `dallas` and `new dallas` gave some news articles about the `dallas` city in Texas but it was of no use. Searching for all the train lines running in dallas also didn't give any information regarding our picture.

Zooming the pictue, one can observe the blurred letters which resembles `chinese` or `japanese` characters, thus we shifted our search over there from Texas.

[Geospy Ai](https://geospy.web.app/) also confirms this thing to some extent, so we start looking for railway lines in China and Japan now ( Still unsure ).
