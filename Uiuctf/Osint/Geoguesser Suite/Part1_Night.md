This is the first of the three geoguessing challenges in `UIUCTF 2024`.

The challenge says we need to find the street name and the city from the given image. At first glance, 
we can't figure out anything about the challenge as no text can be found from the image and also it's a night view.

Looking closely, I find that this tower's name or perhaps the logo has been intentionally blurred.
