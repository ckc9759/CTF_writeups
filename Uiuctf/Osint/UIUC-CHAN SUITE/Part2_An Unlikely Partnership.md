This was the second challenge of the 3 challenges in the UIUC-CHAN SUITE. So, we're supposed to find some user profile in this part to get the flag as mentioned in description : `See if you can figure out who.` 

Continuing from where we left,we get back to the threads profile of `LISA`, there's a linkedin account mentioned over there so we hop on to that !

Nothing substantial over there, read the about for hints, the banner and the thumbnail, nothing was in there. I also even searched the comments on the posts and other activities but again no clue except for a fake flag.

After few minutes of scrolling, I went down to `skills` section where an endorsement was there.

The name says `UIUC Chan` and looks like the right directiion as the ctf also starts with `UIUC`. 

`About` section of UIUC Chan reveals the flag to us.
