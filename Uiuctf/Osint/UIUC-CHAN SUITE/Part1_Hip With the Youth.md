This was the first of the 3 challenges in this suite. We are given a social media profile named `LISA` to search for.

We get the instagram profile for the mentioned username. I tried searching for `wayback machine` archives, thumbnail pictures and also the followers but nothing useful was found.
The description of challenge mentions `See if you can find a way to a flag through their Instagram.` which hints that there are multi steps involved.
There is a thread link mentioned so we start exploring that.

There is a thread which says `I've been told if I include a flag with my post I'll get more engagement, well here goes nothing!`. Checking the comments reveals the flag !

The comment by `LISA` is supposedly the correct flag.  

#### Flag : uiuctf{7W1773r_K!113r_321879}
