This was the third part of UIUC CHAN SUITE from **UIUCTF 2024**.

It talks about a public spotify account where the flag could be hidden and also mention of another business partner or maybe UIUC Chan again as in last part.

Continuing again from where we left, we reach again to the linkedin account of [UIUC CHAN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uiuc-chan/).

The about section mentions about spotify as well so looks like we're on the right track.

Looking at the profile, again nothing else was useful. I checked the banner and profile picture again, no posts, nothing on skills. I check the `Contact info` to find a spotify link embedded there.

The same profile pic is there so we know we're doing fine.

There is a single playlist on UIUC Chan spotify profile which has three songs.

Searched everything in there but nothing helped, the songs were irrelevant. Nothing on lyrics as they were actual songs.
