### Chall Desc : All your base are belong to us

```py
We found what is sometimes called a “meme” on Earth which says 
“All your base are belong to us” in an image that is named rather oddly, can you take a look?

Figure out what this is and retrieve the flag.

tU3/k>!{l$TsJ_ap(U.JM(F|6UVs0P0od}Nf[*t;H

Flag format: IGE{XX_XX_XXX_XXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXX}

P.S. This is the most based challenge btw
```
