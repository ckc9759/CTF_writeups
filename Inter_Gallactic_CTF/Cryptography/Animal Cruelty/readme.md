We are given an image with animals. Using reverse image search, we don't get any relevant ciphers or info regarding crypto challenges.

Using intution and after some observation, I figured out it is using the first letter of each animal's name as a character.

Examples : tiger becomes t, snake becomes s, eagle becomes e etc.

Deciphering the code, we get : saveemallpls

#### THE FLAG : IGE{saveemallpls}
